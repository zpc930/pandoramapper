    Installation and Configation
    
    Pandora is based on following libs: 
    
	Qt4  
	
    Evetything else should be plain C/C++ 
    
    Windows users: just try to start it. :-) 


    Linux users:

    *    If you use non-source based distributive, you will most likely
    require a _development_ version of qt library. In ubuntu/debian,
    for example, they are called something like qt-devel-4-something.
    Install this one.
    
    *	Try just running qmake in console, if it doesnt say anything 
    (or at least does not say anything about 'command not found')
    then you most likely already have a development edition.    

    * download and unpack (is already done i guess)
    * cd src
    * qmake
    * make


    FOR BOTH systems:

    * read and edit /congifs/mume.conf
    * run pandora.exe (or pandora for linux/freebsd etc)
    * connect to localhost 3000
    * read mhelp and mhelp command_name for each command :)
      P.S. thanks to Berdo for fixing this little helpfile. :-)
    * add pandora's settings on top of your client settings. 
      (see /configs/pandora.pow)
    
    !!! 
    Watch out - you have to use full names for commands like north, east, look, 
    examine and scout. (see /configs/pandora.pow)

    
    
    
    Keys in OpenGL(Pandora)  window:
    
    mouse, menu etc - as always.
    
    F12, F11, F10 			 - hide/show MENU bar, STATUS bar and 
					   ROOM info accordingly.
    
    left_mouse_button + mouse movements  - move the cam in x and y coordinates.
    
    right_mouse_button + mouse movements - change the x, y angles of view
    
    mouse_wheel 			 - change the Z coordinate
    
    PageUp/PageDown			 - rotate around the Z coordinate
    
    Escape 				 - reset the view/angle setting to 
					   default values.
    
    and for compatibility - older keys:
    
    q, w 				 - change the X coordinate       
    a, s 				 - change the Y coordinate
    y, x				 - change the Z coordinate
    
    r					 - force redraw (openGL/Qt message)
    c					 - force engine analyzer call 
					   (not used though)
